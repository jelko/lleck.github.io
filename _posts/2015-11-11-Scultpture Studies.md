# Singing Bwoy

The singing bwoy is a kinetic soundsculpture driven by wind. Twelve strings are strummed inside while the wind turns the wheel on top of the object. Initially placed in the area of a former shipyard in Bremen Ãœberseestadt, it was meant as a site specific work, fitting in the surrounding as a rusty relic itself, inviting for phantasies of its purpose and destiny.
