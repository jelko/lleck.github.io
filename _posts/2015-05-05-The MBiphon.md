# The MBiphon

The MBiphon is a work in my ongoing exploration of electro acoustic sound-design. It is an acoustic instrument, with physical sound generation and a wooden resonant body. Three metal tongues representing an 'oscillator-like' unit, are actuated by electromagnets producing individual tones. Moreover the single tongues are variable in pitch, since there length is controllable by a roller system, which is precisely moved by stepper motors, which could be adjusted by MIDI commands. Both the tongues and the magnets themselves are, this way, tunable in frequency, enabling the player to create dissonant tunings, resulting in clear tones, pulsing tones as well as rich overtones. Those are amplified by the wooden body, but could always be extracted on the line level output for further processing.
