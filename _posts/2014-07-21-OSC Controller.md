This is a controller built during a workshop @ HfK Bremen. We built several units. Each holds a gyroscope, an accelerometer, two pushbuttons and a joystick connected to an arduino. These devices are built to send OSC messages to supercollider. Several different programs were written in supercollider to be performed with these controllers.
